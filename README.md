# Assignment 3: Knowledge Representation (Facts + Rules)

## Overview
This repository demonstrates knowledge representation using facts and rules. 

## What is Knowledge Representation?
Knowledge representation is a key concept in artificial intelligence that involves structuring information in a formal way so that a computer system can reason about it. Facts are commonly represented as relationships between entities, and rules are used to infer new knowledge from existing information.

This approach allows systems to derive new conclusions based on known data.

## What the Notebook Does
The Jupyter Notebook:
- Represents knowledge as facts in the form (subject, relation, object)
- Applies a rule-based inference process to derive new facts
- Displays all inferred knowledge
- Executes a query to retrieve specific information from the knowledge base

The notebook output shows the initial facts, inferred facts, and the result of a query.

## Originality Change
To ensure originality, a small logical change was made to the provided example.  
Specifically, an additional fact was included so that multiple inferred facts could be generated, resulting in a richer inference and query result.

## How to Run
1. Open `knowledge_representation.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
2. Run all cells
3. Ensure all outputs are visible
